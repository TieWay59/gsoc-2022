# Coding Period 1 Work

- I decide to use Grimoirelab as my implementation platform and Gitee as my datasource.
- We had a meetings with Venu, Mabel & Yehui at the end of this week (finally, yes, meeting's harder than we thought). (see: [GSOC 2022 Conversion Rate Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pbl16AL9KL25xh3zThOcWWsQCfOk9yGWuLanXX_mkfM/edit#heading=h.uvvch85p6izn))
- We talked about what the two candidate on same project situation and draw a conclusion that we would create different solutions and let the community to check  if the solution should be accepted & merged by Grimoirelab upstream.

## What blocks

Metric model: After disscussed with Mabel, we think we would make a metric model as our collaborate part, and we will implement our solution separately. This work is blocked because we are not so sure how is our metric model works because this is a work that should be reviewed by many.

## What I plan to do

- Create an organization of my own on github.
- Setup Gitee datasource.
- Discuss with Yehui & Matt about our metric model, and learn what should modified or what to do next.
